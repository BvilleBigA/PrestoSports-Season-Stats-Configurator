# PrestoSports-Season-Stats-Configurator
XML Year to Class Modifier – Simple User Guide

This application allows you to upload an XML file containing sports season data, modifies it internally (e.g., updating year/class information), and lets you download the updated file.

# HOW TO USE THE APP

1. OPEN THE APP
- Double-click the 'Season Stats Configurator.exe' to launch the app.
- You’ll see a simple window with two main buttons.

2. UPLOAD AN XML FILE
- Click the "Upload XML File" button.
- A file dialog will open. Browse to and select your .xml sports season file.
- The label will update to show the selected file name.
- The "Download Modified XML" button will become active.

3. DOWNLOAD THE MODIFIED XML
- After processing, click "Download Modified XML".
- Choose a location to save the updated XML file.
- The app will save your modified data with changes (such as year or class edits).

# IMPORTANT NOTES

- Make sure your XML file is properly structured before uploading.
- Always back up your original XML file before making modifications.
- The modifications are specific (e.g., changing "year" or "class" fields).


# TROUBLESHOOTING
